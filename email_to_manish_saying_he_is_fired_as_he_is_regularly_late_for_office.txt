Subject: Termination of Employment

Dear Manish,

I am writing to inform you that your employment with our company has been terminated, effective immediately. This decision has been made after careful consideration and a thorough review of your attendance record.

As you are aware, punctuality and regular attendance are essential requirements for your role. Unfortunately, you have consistently failed to meet these expectations, regularly arriving late to the office and disrupting the workflow of your colleagues. Despite numerous verbal warnings and discussions, your tardiness has continued, and we have been left with no choice but to take this step.

Your constant lateness has not only affected your own productivity but also impacted the team's overall performance and morale. We have tried to work with you to address this issue, but unfortunately, we have not seen the necessary improvements.

You will receive your final paycheck within the next two weeks, as per company policy, which will include payment for all accrued but unused leave. You will also be eligible for any outstanding benefits, as outlined in your employment contract.

Please return all company property, including your laptop, phone, and any other company materials, to the HR department by the end of the day. You will also be required to surrender your access card and any other company-issued identification.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or the HR department. We appreciate your contributions to the company during your time with us, but we cannot continue to tolerate your lack of punctuality and commitment to your role.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
