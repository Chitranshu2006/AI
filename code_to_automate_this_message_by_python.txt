Here's an example of a Python script that automates the process of writing an essay on a given topic, using a template-based approach. In this example, we'll use the `random` module to select a topic from a list and then fill in a template with the topic and some random text.

```python
import random
import time

# List of essay topics
topics = ["sunrise", "cow", "nature", "climate change", "sustainability"]

# Template for the essay
template = """
**The {} Essay**

The {}, a phenomenon that occurs {}, is a spectacle of unparalleled beauty. As the first {} of {} breaks on the horizon, the world is bathed in a warm, golden glow, signaling the beginning of a new {}. The {} is more than just a natural occurrence; it is a symbol of {}, {}, and the infinite possibilities that each {} brings.

**Aesthetic Appeal**

The {} is a breathtakingly beautiful sight, a kaleidoscope of colors that paints the sky with hues of {}, {}, {}, and {}. The gradual {} of the sky, as the {} rises above the horizon, is a sight to behold. The soft, gentle {} of {} gradually gives way to the vibrant, radiant beams of the {}, casting a warm glow over the landscape.

**Symbolism of {}**

The {} is rich in symbolism, representing the cycle of {}, {}, and {}. It signifies the end of {} and the beginning of {}, {}, and {}. The rising {} is a powerful metaphor for the human experience, reminding us that each {} brings a new chance to start anew, to leave the past behind, and to forge a brighter {}.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the {} is a majestic and awe-inspiring phenomenon that transcends its role as a natural occurrence to become a powerful symbol of {}, {}, and {}. Its beauty, symbolism, and impact on human experience make it a universal and timeless phenomenon that continues to inspire, motivate, and uplift us.

This script will generate an essay on a random topic, fill in a template with the topic and some random words, and then save the essay to a file. The essay will be generated every 5 seconds.

Note that this is a very basic example and the generated essays will not be very coherent or well-written. You may want to improve the template and the word selection process to generate more meaningful and well-written essays.
